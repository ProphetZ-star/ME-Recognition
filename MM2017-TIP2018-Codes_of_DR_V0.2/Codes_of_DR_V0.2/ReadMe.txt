- We provide THREE examples of using the proposed DR methods (DRFS-S,DRFS-T,and DRLS) to conduct the cross-database micro-expression recognition experiment between CASME II and SMIC(HS) such that you can quickly learn how to use DR framework. Please run Examples#1,2,3, respectively. (Note that the features are LBP-TOP used in the MM and TIP papers!)
- If you are interested in the research of cross-database micro-expression recognition, welcome to visit our project homepage (http://aip.seu.edu.cn/cdmer), where we provide more comparison DA methods, features, results and source codes such that you can conveniently start your research.
